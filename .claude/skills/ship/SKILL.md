You are running the ship workflow. Follow every step in order.

## 1. Understand the changes

- Run `git status` and `git diff` (staged + unstaged)
- Run `git log --oneline main..HEAD` to see commits on this branch
- If on `main`, create a new branch with a descriptive kebab-case name

## 2. Update core docs

Read `core-docs/history.md` and `core-docs/plan.md`.

For each meaningful change on this branch:
- Add an entry to `core-docs/history.md` following the existing format (what, why, decisions, tradeoffs). Use today's date. Skip if an entry already exists.
- Update `core-docs/plan.md` -- mark completed items, update "Current focus" if needed.

If the user gave feedback during this session that isn't already captured:
- Add a synthesized entry to `core-docs/feedback.md`

## 3. Stage and commit

- Stage all relevant files (code + doc updates). Never stage `.env`, secrets, or credentials.
- Write a concise commit message explaining **why** the change was made.

## 4. Push and create PR

- Push with `-u` flag
- Create a PR using `gh pr create` with:
  - Short title (under 70 characters)
  - Body with `## Summary` (1-3 bullets) and `## Test plan` (checklist)

## 5. Merge

- Ask the user how to merge if not obvious from project conventions (squash, merge commit, rebase)
- Ask which branch to merge into if the project uses a staging/integration branch before main
- Merge using the appropriate `gh pr merge` strategy
- Confirm success and return the PR URL
